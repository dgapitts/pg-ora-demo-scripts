dave=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

dave=# \timing on

dave=# CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ulysses_trigram on ulysses using gin(line_text  gin_trgm_ops);

dave=# select line_num, line_text from ulysses where line_text ILIKE '%brit%';
 line_num |                                line_text
